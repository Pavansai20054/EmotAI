# 🎉 EmojAI: Enhancing Digital Communication with AI-Powered Emoji Suggestions 🤖✨

EmojAI is an innovative project designed to make digital conversations more expressive, empathetic, and inclusive. By leveraging artificial intelligence and natural language processing (NLP), EmojAI suggests contextually appropriate emojis based on real-time sentiment analysis, helping users convey emotions that are often lost in text-based interactions.

## 🧠 What is EmojAI?

EmojAI tackles the challenge of expressing emotions in written digital communication, where non-verbal cues (like facial expressions or tone of voice) are absent. It employs a **hybrid NLP and rule-based approach** to:

- Detect **primary**, **secondary**, and **mixed emotions** (e.g., "happy-sad" 😃😢)
- Map emotions to relevant emojis, considering **intensity modifiers** (e.g., "very happy" 😄)
- Offer **transparent explanations** for each emoji suggestion, setting it apart from generic emoji keyboards
